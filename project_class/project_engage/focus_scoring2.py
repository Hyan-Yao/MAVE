'''
Engagement scoring (fine): read minute-level and grid-level preprocessor output, score every 3-minute window.
LLM → anchor + acceptable_deviation → reconstruct_confidence → expected MAE → engagement.

调参重点：alpha，alpha越小，confidence越偏向于anchor，alpha越大，confidence越偏向于0和3。

ENGAGEMENT_PROMPT = """
You are a behavioral engagement evaluation model.

You are given observational evidence (scene descriptions from visual frames) describing a person's
visible behavior across a 3-minute window (three 1-minute segments, one paragraph per minute).

### EXPERT SCORING LOGIC (Reference for scoring)
High Score (Focus Indicators): Nodding, Moving closer to screen, Active hand movements, Speaking.
Mid Score: Smiling, Hand on mouth (thinking), Consistent pose, Gesture+Speaking.
Low Score (Distraction Indicators): Yawning, Slouching, Hand at back of head, Playing hands.

Engagement is defined on FOUR ordered levels:
0 - Not Engaged:
- frequent looking away or down
- obvious inattentive behavior（(Yawning, Slouching) ）

1 - Barely Engaged:
- weak or unstable attention
- inconsistent orientation or posture
- mostly low-score or inconsistent behaviors.

2 - Engaged:
- generally oriented forward
- stable posture most of the time
- mid-score behaviors (Smile, Thinking), minor lapses.

3 - Highly Engaged:
- this is the DEFAULT level when evidence shows high-score indicators (Nodding, Leaning in) or stable forward orientation and posture
- no dominant or sustained distraction
- brief lapses are acceptable

You must make a holistic judgment based on the OVERALL tendency across all segments.

Strict calibration policy:
- Do not avoid low scores. Use 0 and 1 whenever evidence supports them.
- Do not avoid high scores. Use 3 whenever strong forward/stable engagement is evident.
- Do NOT use Level 2 as a safe middle ground. If the person shows recurring distractions or "passive" looking, you can consider drop to Level 1.
- If deciding between 2 and 3, lean toward 3 when there is no strong evidence of sustained distraction.
- If deciding between 1 and 2, use 1 when attention is unstable or often not forward.


---

### ORDINAL JUDGMENT INSTRUCTIONS (IMPORTANT)

Based on the definitions above, first choose the SINGLE engagement
level (0–3) that best represents the overall behavior.
This will be referred to as the ANCHOR level.

Then, assess whether neighboring engagement levels could still be
reasonable interpretations of the same evidence, considering the
ORDER of the levels.

Specifically, judge the following ordinal deviations from the anchor:

- Is a ONE-LEVEL LOWER interpretation (anchor - 1) still plausible?
- Is a ONE-LEVEL HIGHER interpretation (anchor + 1) still plausible?
- Is a TWO-LEVEL LOWER interpretation (anchor - 2) plausible?
- Is a TWO-LEVEL HIGHER interpretation (anchor + 2) plausible?

These judgments must respect ordinal distance:
- A two-level deviation should NOT be considered plausible
  if the corresponding one-level deviation is not plausible.
- Larger deviations should be treated as less plausible
  than smaller deviations.

Do NOT assign probabilities or confidence scores directly.
Only make binary plausibility judgments for each deviation.
