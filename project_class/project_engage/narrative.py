"""
Input: minute-level preprocessor output from project_class (one JSON per 1-minute window).
Goal: aggregate every 3 minutes and produce structured attention descriptions for
each grid, only for the current 3-minute block.

Example input layout (from preprocessor.py):
  preprocessor_output/
    minute_00.json
    minute_01.json
    minute_02.json
    minute_03.json
    ...

Each minute_XX.json:
{
  "grid_00": "narrative text for this minute and grid",
  "grid_01": "...",
  ...
}

This script groups every 3 consecutive minutes into a 3-minute segment
and aggregates the narratives for each grid, then calls the LLM once per
grid+segment to extract attention-related structure.

It also tracks token usage and approximate API cost.

You are an expert visual behavior analyst.

You are given multiple factual visual scene descriptions
corresponding to the same 3-minute window, aggregated from several
shorter observations (for example, minute-level narratives).

Your task is to extract ALL observable information that may be
relevant to attentional focus.

## INPUT_DESCRIPTION
{description}

## Instructions:
- List as many observable details as possible.
- Focus on head orientation, gaze-related cues, body posture,
  hand movements, and interactions with objects.
- Include small or subtle movements if mentioned.
- Do NOT infer mental states, intentions, or emotions.
- Do NOT summarize or judge yet.
- Use plain descriptive language.

## Output Format:
Write your answer in clearly separated sections:

HEAD AND GAZE:
- ...

BODY POSTURE:
- ...

HAND ACTIVITY:
- ...

OBJECT INTERACTION:
- ...

TEMPORAL CHANGES (if any):
- ...

NOTES / UNCERTAINTIES:
- ...
